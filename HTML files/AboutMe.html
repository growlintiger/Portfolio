    <p>
      As a student at KIIT, I am pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science
      and Communication Engineering, with a passion for programming and 3D
      modelling. I am also enrolled in a B.Sc degree in Data Science from IIT
      Madras, where I am learning to apply statistical and computational methods
      to analyze and interpret data. I have a basic grasp of C and Python
      programming languages, and I am eager to improve my coding skills and
      learn new frameworks and tools. I am also interested in using Blender, a
      powerful and versatile software for creating 3D models and animations. I
      have created some simple models and scenes, and I want to explore more
      features and techniques to produce realistic and stunning results. My goal
      is to combine my programming and 3D modelling skills to develop innovative
      and engaging applications and projects.
